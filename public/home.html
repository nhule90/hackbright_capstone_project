                You wonder how we or any living things pass on their species traits to the next generation? We have an explainantion for you.

            Most of living things use DNA as their genetic material. Only a few viruses use RNA to pass on their genetic traits.</p>

                DNA is a double-stranded material. It contains all the genetic informations that will form a perfect body in any species. Any changes, mutations, in DNA will be passed down to the next generation and will likely cause some diseases or a start of an evolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                RNA, on the other hand, is single-stranded. In order to reproduce, virus will need a host body to use their materials to produce DNA from RNA and mulplity themselves.

            <h2>Mutation. What causes mutation and what happens after mutation?</h2>
            <h4>Mutation happens on a daily basis in our life. So are all mutations bad?</h4>
            <p><img src="https://tinyurl.com/mutationinbio" alt="DNA mutation"> Mutation are all changes that happens inside the DNA. DNA is structured in a way to prevent changes as much as possible because it is very important to any species to keep their genetic material intact. However, environment can trigger those changes, for example: UV light, food, lifestyle, etc.</p>
            <section>
                <p>
                Mutation happens quite often in our life. However, some of the mutations will not express in the phenotype, so that we will not notice any changes in our children. There are a few changes that will cause huge impact on the phenotypes and will catch our attention rightaway, though.
            </p>
            <p>
                In most cases, mutation that expresses in phenotype will lead to diseases with a negative effect on the mutated body. However, rarely, a few mutation is actually the beginning of a great evolution process.
